<h1>
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) 
</h1>

<article>
<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
he studied under another giant of mathematics, Jean 
Bernoulli. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
publishing over 800 different books and papers. His 
influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

<p>He is perhaps best known for his research into 
mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) &agrave;, 
remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
he wrote 
Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772) &agrave;, 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
physical theories of the time.</p>

<p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
as e and &pi;, were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

<h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

<p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:</p>

<code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e^xi</code>

<p>which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
equation, it's easy to derive the identity:</p>

<code>e^[pi]i+1=0</code>

<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 
0, 1, [pi], e, and i in a single beautiful and 
elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by The Mathematical Intelligencer&agrave;
magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of 
mathematics.</p>
